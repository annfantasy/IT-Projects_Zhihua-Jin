## 1 Introduction

This is a product that would help patients self-diagnose their COPD symptoms  as well as manage their biological measurements. Once a high risk of COPD is diagnosed in the app, the patient could choose to make appointments with their doctors and manage these appointments. Besides, there will be a learning section to educate patients so they can maintain good health.

## 2 Process Description

**Phase I  Demand Analysis**

To figure out the real needs from patients and examine the critical patient data required for doctors to diagnose, we will use scholar search engine to find out and combine information from all resources. We will define app functions according to these needs.

Input: literature review about COPD's background information and needs research from stakeholders

Output: demand analysis document 

**Phase II Prototype Design**

Prototype design tools like Axure etc. would be used to construct the app prototype. The prototype will have basic interface for the functions we decided to develop.

Input: function design (demand analysis document)

Output: app prototype

**Phase III Software Development**

Starting with architectural design and database construction, server development, the developers will write specific code to realize the functions of each component respectively.A web app using H5 would be developed (front end: Vue, Angular, etc. & Back end: Spring, Hibernate, etc.).

Input: app prototype, software framework 

Output: app 

**Phase IV Test & HDAP deployment**

Real data will be tested on the app to figure out bugs. Bugs will be fixed and the app will be put on HDAP server to run.

Input: real data accessed from FHIR server

Output: logs and test reuslts, a complete app that could work on HDAP
